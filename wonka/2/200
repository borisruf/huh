So, the lady is talking about a very clever robot. This robot can write stuff like stories, emails, draw pictures, make videos or even make music. But it needs help from humans to know what to create. This robot is really smart, but it can't think like we do. Instead, it learns from lots and lots of books, articles, or other things people have written, and then makes new stuff by copying the patterns it noticed in them. Just like when we play with Lego, this smart robot breaks down all the text into small pieces, like single words, to understand them better. Then it practices guessing what word comes next in a sentence. Some words are more important than others, just like when we listen to a teacher, we focus more on the main points and skip the boring parts. This smart robot does the same thing, it pays more attention to the important words. So, when you ask this robot something, it doesn't really answer like we do in a conversation, but it continues the writing in the way it learned. This is a very cool thing, and it can help us do our work better.
