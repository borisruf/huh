So, imagine you have a huge toy box full of different toys. Now, if you want to find a particular toy, it can be hard to do that when everything is mixed up. What tokenization does is it takes these toys and puts similar ones together in smaller boxes. This way, it's easier for us to find the toy we are looking for. It's the same with texts, they break them into smaller parts so the computer can understand and work with it better.
