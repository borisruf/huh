Generative AI is like a super cool and smart robot that can make up new stories, pictures or songs when you ask it! It learns from a lot of things it has seen before and tries to make up something new that makes sense. But, it doesn't just think of everything at once. It's like when you're trying to solve a puzzle, you don't try to look at all the pieces at the same time, you look at one piece then try to find where it fits, right? The robot does something similar, it breaks down what you say into smaller parts (like puzzle pieces) and looks at them one by one, to figure out what it should make up next. It gives more attention to the most important parts, just like a detective who looks at all the clues but only focuses on the ones that help solve the case. So, this robot doesn't really answer the questions we ask in the same way we would, instead it tries to continue the story we started. This cool robot can help us do our work faster and better, but we still need people to help make it work properly.
