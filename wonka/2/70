Generative AI is like having an imaginative robot friend who can not only talk, but also create pictures, sounds, and videos on their own when you give them a certain idea. This robot friend learns from lots of information it gets and can make fresh and meaningful creations from your idea. This can help us in our work, like writing emails or thinking of new ideas. They are especially good at coming up with interesting words and sentences. There's a super special kind of this robot that we will likely use first in our work. It's called Large Language Models.
