Generative AI is like a big computer brain that can write new stories or make new pictures when we tell it what to kind of thing we want. It learns how to do this by being shown lots and lots of examples. When we ask it to write something for us, it breaks the task into smaller parts, like learning each word and what it means, and then it tries to guess what the next word should be. There's a special part of it called transformers that helps it decide what words are more important to think about. It's kind of like how detectives find clues to figure out who did something, they pay more attention to some clues than others. And that helps the computer brain write a good response to what we ask it to do.
