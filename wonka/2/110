So basically, imagine you give a toy robot lots of books to read and each time it reads, it learns how words are used and how sentences are formed. Then if you ask it a question or to write a story, it will use what it learned from all those books to give an answer or create a new story. But remember, the robot is just copying what it learned, it's not coming up with new ideas. To make it easier for the robot to remember what it read, we can break down the books into smaller pieces, like one word or a little bit of a word at a time. Then, the robot can concentrate on understanding and learning these little pieces one by one.
