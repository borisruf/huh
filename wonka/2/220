Generative AI is like a really clever robot that can make things like stories, pictures, videos, or sounds if you tell it what you want. This robot learns from lots and lots of things it's seen or heard before, so it can make really good stuff that fits what you asked for. At our company, we could use this robot to write emails or come up with ideas for our work. Imagine you have lots of Lego pieces, which represent words or parts of a word. This robot AI can take these small bits, and try to guess what should come next in order to build something. When you give it a mission to make something, it doesn't always treat all the Lego pieces the same way. Instead, it pays more attention to the most helpful pieces and uses them more. It's just like a detective who only pays attention to the most important clues to solve a case. This helps it to better understand what you want and make something that makes sense. This super cool robot AI technology is a great tool that can help us do better at our company. We just need to make sure that people are always in charge, and checking what the robot makes.
