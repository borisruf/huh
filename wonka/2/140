Generative AI is like a smart robot that can make new things like stories, pictures, or sounds when we tell it what we want. It learns to do this by studying lots and lots of examples. At our company, Wonka Industries, we might use it to help write emails or come up with new ideas. It has a special part called a "Large Language Model" or LLM thatâ€™s really good at understanding and making sentences. But remember, it isn't really thinking - it's just copying what it's seen before in a smart way. One way it does this is by breaking down big blocks of text into tiny pieces, like words or parts of words, so it can focus on each piece one at a time. It's a bit like a jigsaw puzzle. Then, it tries to guess what piece comes next. It does this by using something called Transformers which helps it figure out which words are most important. So, just like you pay more attention to the most exciting bits of a story, the computer does the same when deciding which word comes next!
