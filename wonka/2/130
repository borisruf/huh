Generative AI is like an artist, but for a computer. It can make new things like drawings, music, or stories. Imagine if you tell this computer to write a story about a unicorn, it can do it, even if it's never seen a unicorn before! When we at Wonka Industries use it, it can help us a lot with our work, like writing emails or reports. It can do this because it's been taught with lots and lots of information, and it uses this information to make up its stories or drawings. It learns just like you do, imagine youâ€™re learning a new word. This computer does the same thing, it breaks down the information into smaller parts, like words or even parts of words, so it can understand it better. It practices over and over, trying to guess what word comes next in a sentence, until it gets really good at it. Then, when you ask it a question or give it a task to write about, it uses what it's learned to make something new! And the best part, these smart computers are called Transformers, just like the robot superheroes in the cartoon!
