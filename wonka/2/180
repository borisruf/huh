So, think of the AI like a super smart robot that's really good at playing make believe. It doesn't know what it's saying but it can look at what you're asking it, remember what it learned from lots of books it has read before, and make up an answer that sounds like it knows what it's talking about. It's a bit like if you were playing a game of pretend and you used what you have seen in your favorite cartoon to act like a superhero. The robot isn't really a superhero, but it plays one really well.
