Imagine if you have a big box of your favorite legos, but you're only allowed to play one block at a time. That's kind of what tokenization does -- it breaks down a big lump of words into little pieces, like your lego blocks. And just like you decide which Lego piece you need next to build your tower, this thing called a transformer helps the computer to choose the right word to use next when it's trying to say something. But transformers can also do something you can't -- they can decide which Lego piece, or word, is most important. That is their "attention mechanism", kind of like when Mom tells you to pay attention to what she's saying!
