The lady is talking about something called Generative AI. Imagine you have a magic box that can create a new drawing, story, song, or movie when you tell it what you want. This magic box gets its powers from looking at tons and tons of other drawings, stories, songs, or movies, so it knows what to make for you. At her job, this magic box can help write emails or reports, or create new ideas. The first one they'll probably use at her work is the kind that writes stories or texts. The magic behind it all is something called Large Language Models, which are like big, smart brains that know a lot about human language because they have read tons of text.
