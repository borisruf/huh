Generative AI is like a very smart robot that can create new things like words, pictures, videos, or sounds when you give it a hint or tell it what to do. It learns to do this by looking at lots and lots of examples, so it can come up with something unique and fitting based on the hint you gave. At our workplace, this smart robot can help us write emails or reports, or even come up with new ideas.
