So Generative AI is like a robot that can create new things like stories, pictures, or videos when you tell it what you want. It works by learning from a lot of examples and it can help us with our tasks like writing emails or coming up with new ideas. It uses something called LLMs that learn how we talk by reading lots of text. They can't have their own thoughts, but they can make things that seem new by copying what they learned. It's like when you tell them a beginning of a story, they can guess what comes next by remembering similar stories they've read. They focus only on the important parts of what you tell them, just like detectives who only pay attention to the important clues to solve a mystery. This cool robot, or the Generative AI, won't actually answer your questions but will continue the story you started. This might be really helpful for us because we can use it in many different ways, but we also have to be careful and remember it might sometimes guess things wrong.
