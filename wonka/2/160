Attention is like when you're playing a game of hide and seek. Just like how you focus more on some spots you think your friend could be hiding more than others, this "Attention" concept helps the computer focus on certain parts of the information you give it more than others to come up with the best response! Just like the detective in a mystery game focuses on clues that seem most important.
