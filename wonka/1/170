The speaker is discussing Large Language Models (LLMs), which are types of Generative AI that simulate human language. LLMs can't originate thoughts, but they create text that appears original by replicating patterns learned during training. The process includes breaking down large chunks of training text into smaller parts (tokens) that they can understand and from which they learn to predict further tokens. Transformers, an essential part of LLMs, use a weighting mechanism to calculate the next words in a sequence, giving different attention to different parts of the entered prompt, a concept similar to detectives focusing on specific clues crucial for solving a case. This mechanism was introduced by Google in a paper titled "Attention is all you need."
