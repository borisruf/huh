In simple terms, the speaker teaches about Generative AI, a type of artificial intelligence that uses a lot of training data to create new content in response to human prompts. She outlines that it will be helpful at Wonka Industries, particularly in textual content generation. She introduces Large Language Models (LLMs), which mimic human language and give seemingly original responses without having original thoughts themselves. LLMs break down their training information into manageable parts, called "tokens," to improve their understanding and prediction of next tokens. A key part of LLMs, called transformers, help analyze tokens considering their relative importance to predict the following sequence, just like human focus varies in different parts of information. The concept of focusing on important information, termed "attention," was introduced by Google.
