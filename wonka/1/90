By the conclusion of this video, the viewer should have a more comprehensive knowledge of Generative AI, the technology behind it, and its applications in both everyday life and workplace scenarios at Wonka Industries. The speaker talks about how Generative AI can create new, unique content like text, images, videos, or audio based on a human-given prompt. This AI model is powered by vast quantities of training data, allowing it to respond contextually and uniquely to these prompts. It can aid in creating emails or reports and can offer alternative viewpoints in brainstorm sessions at Wonka Industries. Initially, Wonka Industries is most likely to use the version of Generative AI that generates text content. Such AI technology, which sits at the heart of this innovative wave, is known as Large Language Models or LLMs. LLMs are essentially neural networks developed to comprehend and generate human language, trained on innumerable text data. Although they can't generate original thoughts, they are capable of providing seemingly original responses by mimicking patterns they learned during training, undergoing numerous instructional stages where their learning is turned into data.
