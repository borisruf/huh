The speaker toward the end of the video, discusses the concept of attention and relates it with the context of Large Language Models (LLMs). The attention mechanism in LLMs is compared to how a detective would focus on essential pieces of evidence while ignoring irrelevant details in order to solve a case. The LLMs uses this attention mechanism to focus on significant parts of a text, helping it to understand the context and meaning. The objective is not necessarily to answer a question but to continue generating text in a sensible and coherent manner based on the prompt.
