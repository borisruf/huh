In the video the speaker is describing Generative AI, a type of artificial intelligence that can produce new content like text, images, videos or audio in response to a prompt given by a human. It's powered by enormous volumes of training data which allows it to generate unique and contextually fitting responses to given prompts. In Wonka Industries, this technology can assist in tasks such as email writing, report creation, and brainstorming. The narrator mentions that the first application of this technology will most likely be in the form of text generation. This function is led by a system called Large Language Models (LLMs), a type of neural network trained to mimic human language patterns on a large scale. Despite its capability to produce seemingly original content, these models can't form original ideas. It's also explained that the model undergoes several training stages where it tokenize or breaks down information into digestible units for efficient processing.
