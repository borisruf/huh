The speaker is talking about Generative AI, a technology that creates original content such as text, images, and videos based on input provided by humans. The technology uses large amounts of training data, which enables it to generate unique and relevant outputs. At Wonka Industries, this AI technology may be first used to generate textual content, with LLM or Large Language ModelsÂ being key. LLMs are neural networks specifically designed to understand and generate human language. Though incapable of original thought, they can produce seemingly original text by mimicking patterns they have learnt during training. The process of 'tokenization' breaks down large blocks of text into smaller chunks, making the information easier for the computer to process. Transformers, a crucial aspect of LLMs, help in the weighted analysis of these tokens to predict the next words in a sequence. Just like a detective focusing only on relevant details to solve a case, the transformer employs an 'attention mechanism' to focus only on important parts of the input text. Finally, the speaker concludes by stressing upon the exciting potential of Generative AI and LLMs in new technology.
