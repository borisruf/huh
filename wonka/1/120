The speaker is detailing the process and mechanisms that underlie Generative AI technologies often used at Wonka Industries, which primarily include text-generation AI. She emphasizes the role of Large Language Models (LLMs), neural networks tasked with comprehending and generating human language that are trained on extensive volumes of text. Although these networks do not create original thoughts, they can simulate originality by mimicking patterns learned during their training. They process these patterns by "tokenizing" them, breaking them into tiny parts for improved comprehension. The ultimate goal is to predict the next "token" or piece in the sequence.
