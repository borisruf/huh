The speaker is discussing Large Language Models (LLMs), an integral part of Generative AI. LLMs are neural networks trained on extensive volumes of text, allowing them to replicate human language patterns and generate seemingly original responses, even though they lack original thinking. They undergo processes like tokenization, converting information into numerals (tokens), which help in the efficient processing of data. By breaking down large blocks of text into smaller fragments and learning to predict the following token in a sequence, LLMs can generate appropriate responses to prompts.
